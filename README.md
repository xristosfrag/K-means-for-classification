This repository contains an implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm developed as part of a course assignment in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Ioannina in 2022. The aim of the assignment was to implement the k-means algorithm from scratch using Java and evaluate its performance on a custom dataset.

### Contents
* Assignment.pdf: Contains the assignment prompt and specifications.
* Report.pdf: Contains the report for the assignment, including an analysis of the implementation and the results obtained.
* /src/Kmeans.java: Contains the implementation of the k-means algorithm in Java.
* /src/Cluster.java: Contains the points assigned to each cluster
* /src/Point.java: Provides the implementation of the concept of a point used in the k-means algorithm.
The use of these additional classes (Cluster, Point) helps to organize the code and improve its readability.

### Usage
To use the implementation, simply download the NetworkNeurons.java file and incorporate it into your Java project.
